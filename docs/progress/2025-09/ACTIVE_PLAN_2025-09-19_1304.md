# ACTIVE PLAN: RAG Tool Retriever Integration

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-19
**Phase:** Integration & Production Readiness

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Mission
Integrate the completed RAG tool retriever system into MetaMCP's main codebase and prepare for production deployment.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Integration Architecture (Current Focus)
- [ ] **Map Integration Points**
  - Identify where RAG retriever plugs into MetaMCP core
  - Document API contracts between RAG system and main app
  - Plan configuration management for tool selection thresholds

- [ ] **Core Integration**
  - Integrate `retriever.py` into MetaMCP middleware stack
  - Add RAG-based tool filtering to request processing pipeline
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for retrieval failures

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - Add RAG configuration to MetaMCP config system
  - Environment variables for vector DB location, thresholds
  - Tool selection strategy configuration (top-k, similarity threshold)

### Phase 2: Production Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**
  - Benchmark retrieval latency vs context savings
  - Optimize ChromaDB configuration for production
  - Implement caching layer for frequent queries

- [ ] **Monitoring & Observability**
  - Add metrics for tool selection effectiveness
  - Context window usage tracking
  - Retrieval accuracy monitoring

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Test RAG system with real MetaMCP workflows
  - Validate context window reduction effectiveness
  - Test edge cases and error handling

- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**
  - Document performance improvements
  - Validate that relevant tools are consistently selected
  - Measure impact on response quality

### Phase 4: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - Update README with RAG capabilities
  - API documentation for new features
  - Deployment guide updates

- [ ] **Docker Integration**
  - Update Dockerfile to include RAG dependencies
  - Environment configuration for production
  - Health checks for vector database

## ðŸ”„ Current Sprint Focus
**Week of 2025-09-19:**
1. Complete integration architecture planning
2. Begin core integration implementation
3. Set up development environment for testing integration

## ðŸš« Out of Scope
- Major refactoring of existing MetaMCP architecture
- Migration away from current tool discovery mechanisms (parallel implementation)
- Real-time tool definition updates (static indexing sufficient for MVP)

## âœ… Prerequisites Met
- RAG retriever system fully implemented and tested
- Tool extraction from live MCP servers working
- ChromaDB integration stable
- Test suite comprehensive

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- Context window usage reduced by 60%+ for tool-heavy requests
- Tool selection accuracy >90% for common use cases
- Integration maintains existing MetaMCP functionality
- Zero performance regression for non-RAG workflows
